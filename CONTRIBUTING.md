## 🌟 Our Contribution Process

To maintain quality and ensure smooth collaboration, we follow a structured contribution process:

### 1. 🎯 Raise an Issue First
Before making any changes, **always start by creating an issue** on GitHub:
- 📝 Describe what you want to add, fix, or improve
- 🏷️ Use appropriate labels (enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.)
- 💬 Allow time for discussion and feedback from the community
- ✅ Wait for a maintainer or collaborator to assign the issue to you

### 2. 💡 Suggest Your Solution
Once your issue is assigned:
- 📋 Comment on the issue with your proposed approach
- 🗣️ Engage with feedback from maintainers and other contributors

After your approach is approved:
